#### Business Problem

* In recent years, city hotel and resort hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels primary goal in order to increase the efficiency in generating revenue and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.

* The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this project.

### Assumptions

* No unusual occurences between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial impact on the data used.
* The information is still current and can be used to analyse a hotel's possible plans in an efficient manner. 
* The hotels are currently not using any of the suggested solutions.

  ### Suggestions

* Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to customers.

* As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So, the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.

* In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.

* They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
